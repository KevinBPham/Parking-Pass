Parking Pass is a program that allows users to purchase parking passes and pay off fines.  It also allows law enforcement or security to use the application to assign fines.
A SQL database is utilized to hold data, utilizing three different tables.  The program is written using html, nodejs, and express.
For this project, I used MySQL as my database.
Launch the local website by typing in "node app.js" into the terminal. The website will be hosted on port 3000.  Make sure that the information to connect to the database is relevant to your PC,
as it will vary by device depending on how SQL is set up on your system.  This is all commented for ease of use.  Because session-express is experiencing problems, the unique adminhome.ejs page is only accessible through index.ejs.  Currently, registering a user, registering a pass,
and assigning a fine will affect the relevant table in the database.
